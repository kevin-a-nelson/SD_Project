Exercise 1 (CQ):  Predict what will be printed for the cerr lines that print “A. “, “B. “, and “C. “.  Take your time to make the prediction; this exercise can help you understand many other cases.
1. 255
2. 1
3. -1


Exercise 2:  Now actually try it: paste in the code to a file called overlap.cpp, compile it (be sure to use ~/show_mem.o on the compile line), and run it in the terminal to see what shows up as a result of the cerr statements.  Explain what happened, including whether your prediction was accurate (do not go back and change your prediction).
Yes. We replaced 2 bytes with a single short.


Exercise 4 (CQ):  Without running the code, figure out what the counter would be at the end of loop A, assuming that n = 10.
Counter will be 20 (goes to 10*2) 


Exercise 5 (CQ):  What is a formula that describes what counter would be for loop A, in terms of n?
C(n) = n*2


Exercise 6 (CQ):  Without running the code, figure out what the counter would be at the end of loop B, assuming that n = 10.
Counter will be 300


Exercise 7 (CQ):  What is a formula that describes what counter would be for loop B, in terms of n?
C(n)=3*n^2


Exercise 8 (CQ):  Without running the code, figure out what the counter would be at the end of loop C, assuming that n = 10.
Counter will be 220


Exercise 9 (CQ):  What is a formula that describes what counter would be for loop C, in terms of n?
C(n)=2*n^2+n*2


Exercise 11 (CQ--copy just the question at the end into your hw5.txt file): What are the values of z1 and z2?
Z1 = (2*3+2)%2=0
Z2 = (5*2+5)%4=1


Exercise 12 (CQ): Briefly explain what the f1 function does.
It’s a countdown from 10 to 1. The program starts if x isn’t equal to 0. It prints x-1 starting at x = 10
