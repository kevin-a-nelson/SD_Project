Exercise 1 (CQ):  For the following code, identify which kind of & is used in each of the places where the & occurs:


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;


int f(int &a, int b) { // 
  int *p;
  p = &b; // “address-of”
  return a & (b + 2); // logical “and”
}


int main() {
  int x = 3, *y;
  int &z = x; // declaring a variable that is a reference
  y = &z; // “address-of”
  z = f(x, z);
  cerr << x << " " << z << endl;




}


Exercise 2 (CQ).  Write out two more equivalences from our five variables above (don’t make new ones).  Don’t just swap the side that a variable or value is on, but actually come up with two that we have not yet expressed.
  &a == 100
  b == e
  *d == b
  e == 'h'
  *c == 5
  c == 100
  B == ‘h’
  *d and *c == b % 5


Exercise 3 (CQ):  For the following code, identify which kind of * is used in each of the places where the * occurs:


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
  
int f(int *a, int b) { //pointer
  int p;
  p = *a; // copy the value of a
  return p * (b + 2); // multiply
}


int main() {
  int x = 3, *y; // pointer
  y = &x;
  int *z; // pointer
  z = y;
  *y = 7; // changes the value of y
  x = f(z, *y); // changed value of y
  cerr << x << endl;
}
